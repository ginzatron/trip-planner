## API Testing

The `postman` directory contains Postman collections for testing the API:

1. Import `Travel Planner.postman_collection` into Postman
2. Import the environment file `trip-planner-local.postman_environment` into Postman
3. If the environment variables are not set, set them up:
   - `trip-planner-url`: `http://localhost:5078` or whatever your local API URL is
